# minecraft-in-css
This is Minecraft created in the Programming Language "CSS" because i saw a comment on a Tik Tok, who mistyped and sayed: "Minecraft was created on css" and I knew I had to do this

<h2>Steps:</h2>

To run Minecraft in css functionally, you have to follow these Steps:

1. Download all the source code files in a .zip file
2. then you have to extract that .zip file in a folder (or where you want to)
3. then start the "index.html"
4. click somewhere in the browser and then you are good to go, minecraft should start susscesfully!
